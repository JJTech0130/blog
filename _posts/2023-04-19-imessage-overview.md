### Prior Art
Everyone knows what iMessage is, but not many know how it works.
A few people have done reasearch on this before, and I've heavily borrowed from them.
Here's an inexhaustive list:
+ [IMFreedom Knowledge Base](https://kb.imfreedom.org/protocols/imessage/)
+ [M. Frister](https://github.com/mfrister/pushproxy)
+ [Nicol√°s](https://gitlab.com/nicolas17/apns-dissector)
+ [QuarkSlab](https://blog.quarkslab.com/imessage-privacy.html)
+ [Garman et al.](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity16/sec16_paper_garman.pdf)
+ [NowSecure](https://www.nowsecure.com/blog/2021/01/27/reverse-engineering-imessage-leveraging-the-hardware-to-protect-the-software/)
+ [Elcomsoft](https://blog.elcomsoft.com/2018/11/imessage-security-encryption-and-attachments/)
+ [Eric Rabil](https://github.com/open-imcore)
+ There's probably others too. If I forgot you, leave a comment.

This is a new way of writing blog posts, where I slowly add to them over time. Hopefully it means that even if I get distracted, it's still useful for others.
